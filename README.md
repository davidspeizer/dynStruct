# dynStruct
dynStruct is a tool using dynamoRio to monitor memory accesses of an ELF binary via a data gatherer,
and use this data to recover structures of the original code.

dynStruct can also be used to quickly find where and by which function a member of a structure is write or read.

## Papers
dynStruct was the subject of my master thesis and also the subject of a publication.  
[Master Thesis](https://kar.kent.ac.uk/58461/)  
[Publication](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7884661/)

## Requirements
### Data gatherer
* CMake >= 2.8
* [DynamoRIO](https://github.com/DynamoRIO/dynamorio) : Do not use the last release of DynamoRIO (there is a compilation error with one of the extension used by dynStruct). The last version at DynamoRIO [cronbuild](https://github.com/DynamoRIO/dynamorio/releases) is recommended. However in case of any problem [build 7.91.18109](https://github.com/DynamoRIO/dynamorio/releases/tag/cronbuild-7.91.18109) was sucessfully tested and can be use as safe fallback.

## Setup
### Data Gatherer 
Set the environment variable DYNAMORIO_HOME to the absolute path of your
DynamoRIO installation

Execute `build.sh`

To compile dynStruct for a 32bits target on a 64bits os execute `build.sh 32`

## Data gatherer

### Usage

```
drrun -opt_cleancall 3 -c <dynStruct_path> <dynStruct_args> -- <prog_path> <prog_args>

  -h print this help
  -o <file_name>	set output name for json file
			 if a file with this name already exist the default name will be used
			 in the case of forks, default name will be used for forks json files
			 (default: <prog_name>.<pid>)
  -d <dir_name>		set output directory for json files
		         (default: current directory)
  - 			print output on console
			 Usable only on very small programs
  -w <module_name>	wrap <module_name>
			 dynStruct record memory blocks only
			 if *alloc is called from this module
  -m <module_name>	monitor <module_name>
			 dynStruct record memory access only if
			 they are done by a monitore module
  -a <module_name>	is used to tell dynStruct which module implements
			 allocs functions (malloc, calloc, realloc and free)
			 this has to be used with the -w option (ex : "-a ld -w ld")
			 this option can only be used one time
for -w, -a and -m options modules names are matched like <module_name>*
this allow to don't care about the version of a library
-m libc.so match with all libc verison

The main module is always monitored and wrapped
Tha libc allocs functions are always used (regardless the use of the -a option)

Example : drrun -opt_cleancall 3 -c dynStruct -m libc.so - -- ls -l

This command run "ls -l" and will only look at block allocated by the program
but will monitor and record memory access from the program and the libc
and print the result on the console
```

### Example

We are going to analyse this little program.

```C
void print(char *str)
{
  puts(str);
  str[1] = 'a';
  puts(str);
}

int main()
{
  char *str;

  str = malloc(5);
  strcpy(str, "test");
  str[4] = 0;
  print(str);

  free(str);
}
```
Which after compilation look like this
![Example disassembly](http://i.imgur.com/L2i4zJS.png)

If we run `drrun -c  dynStruct - -- tests/example` we get
```
test
tast
block : 0x0000000000602010-0x0000000000602015(0x5) was free
alloc by 0x00000000004005b5(main : 0x00000000004005a8 in test_mini) and free by 0x00000000004005ea(main : 0x00000000004005a8 in test_mini)
	 WRITE :
	 was access at offset 1 (1 times)
	details :
			 1 bytes were accessed by 0x0000000000400596 (print : 0x0000000000400576 in test_mini, opcode: c60061) 1 times
	 was access at offset 4 (2 times)
	details :
			 1 bytes were accessed by 0x00000000004005c8 (main : 0x00000000004005a8 in test_mini, opcode: c6400400) 1 times
			 1 bytes were accessed by 0x00000000004005d4 (main : 0x00000000004005a8 in test_mini, opcode: c60000) 1 times
	 was access at offset 0 (1 times)
	details :
			 4 bytes were accessed by 0x00000000004005c2 (main : 0x00000000004005a8 in test_mini, opcode: c70074657374) 1 times
```
We see all the write accesses on str done by the program himself.
We can notice the 4 bytes access at offset 0 of the block due to gcc optimisation for initializing the string.

Now if we run `drrun -c  dynStruct -m libc - -- tests/example` we are going to monitor all the libc accesses, and we get
```
test
tast

```
Now all the read accesses done by the libc are listed.

### Multi-process programs
If you use the data gatherer on a multi-process program, a file per process will be written.
This allow to analyse each process independently.
In the case of an execution of an other program the new file will have the name of the program executed.
If you don't want the data gatherer to follow new processes use the options -no_follow_children for drrun (example : `drrun -no_follow_children -opt_cleancall 3 -c dynStruct -m libc.so - -- ls -l`)

### Output
In order to reduce the memory overhead of the data gatherer, if there is an output file the data will be written in it every 100 block free.

### Known issues
The buffering has an issue on my setup when analyzing xterm, no problem with other program or other systems. The issue is a bit of the json output is missing. If you have this issue as well please fill an issue with detail of your setup and of the program analyzed. To fix it if needed comment the macro in includes/out_json.h and uncomment the first macro named DS_PRINTF.

## Structure recovery

The python script dynStruct.py do the structure recovery and can start the web_ui.

The idea behind the structure recovery is to have a quick idea of the structures used by the program.

It's impossible to recover exactly the structures used in the original source code, so some choices had to be made.
To recover the size of members dynStruct.py look at the size of the accesses for a particular offset, it keep the more used
size, if 2 or more size are used the same number of time it keep the smaller size.

The default types are ```int<size>_t```, all the default names are ```offset_<offset_in_the_struct>```.
Some offset in blocks have no read or write accesses in the ouput of the dynStruct dynamoRIO client, so the empty offset are fill
with array called ```pad_offset<offset_in_the_struct>```, all pading are uint8_t.
Array are detected, 5 or more consecutive members of a struct with the same size is considered as an array.
Array are named ```array_<offset_in_the_struct>```.
The last thing that is detected is array of structure, named ```struct_array_<offset_in_the_struct>```    

dynStruct also record the assembly instruction which does the access and a context instruction, the context instruction is the next one in the case of a read access and the previous one in the case of write access.  
This context allow to recover type of structure members, the recovered type are pointer (when possible with commentaire for struct pointer and array pointer), function pointer, double, float, signed integer and unsigned integer. When a type is recovered it replace the type in the default type of the structure member.  
This context analysis if not 100% reliable but is usually right.

The recovery of struct try to be the most compact as possible, the output will look like :
```
struct struct_14{
	int32_t array_0x0[5];
	struct {
		int64_t offset_0x0;
		int8_t offset_0x8;
		int8_t pad_offset_0x9[7];
	}struct_array_0x14[2];
} 
```
The recovery process can take a few minutes if there are large blocks.
### Usage
```
usage: dynStruct.py [-h] [-d DYNAMO_FILE] [-p PREVIOUS_FILE] [-o OUT_PICKLE]
                    [-n] [-e <file_name>] [-c] [-w] [-l BIND_ADDR]

Dynstruct analize tool

optional arguments:
  -h, --help        show this help message and exit
  -d DYNAMO_FILE    output file from dynStruct dynamoRio client
  -p PREVIOUS_FILE  file to load serialized data
  -o OUT_PICKLE     file to store serialized data.
  -n                just load json without recovering structures
  -e <file_name>    export structures in C style on <file_name>
  -c                print structures in C style on console
  -w                start the web view
  -l BIND_ADDR      bind addr for the web view default 127.0.0.1:24242
```
### Example
```
gcc tests/test.c -o tests/test
drrun -opt_cleancall 3 -c dynStruct -o out_test -- tests/test
python3 dynStruct.py -d out_test  -c
```
will display
```
//total size : 0x20
struct struct_2 
{	int32_t offset_0x0;
	int32_t offset_0x4;
	int32_t offset_0x8;
	uint8_t pad_offset_0xc[4];
	void(*ptr_fun)() offset_0x10;
	int8_t offset_0x18;
	uint8_t pad_offset_0x19[7];
};
```

The same output can be obtained via a serialized file:
```
python3 dynStruct.py -d out_test  -o serialize_test
python3 dynStruct.py -p serialize_test -c
```

Serialized file allow you to load data from a binary without having to redo the structure recovery. Serialized file also saved modification done to structures via the web ui.

### Recovery accuracy
The recovering of structure is actually not always 100% accurate but it can still give you a good idea of the internal structures of a program. Improving this will be the main goal in the following month.  

### Known issue
For now the script dynStruct.py keep all loaded data from the json on memory in diverse objects. This mean for big json file (multiple hundred of Mo) the memory consumption of this script is very high and may even run out of memory, making the structure recovery process through dynStruct.py impossible. This is not a priority right now but in the future this issue will have a particular attention.

## Web interface
DynStruct has a web interface which display raw data from the gatherer and the structures recovered by dynStruct.py

This web interface can be start by using dynStruct.py with the -w option (and -l to change the listening ip/port of the interface).

If we took the last previous example we can start the web interface with:
```
python3 dynStruct.py -p serialize_test -w
```
When you go to the web interface you will see something like:
![Block search view](http://i.imgur.com/YdJqAQx.png)

### Navigation
The navbar on top allow you to switch between the different data dynStruct can display.  
Blocks and accesses are raw data from data gatherer (but more readable than console ouput of the gatherer and with search fields).  
Structures contain structures recovered by dynStruct.py and the structures created by the user if any.  
Download header allow you to download a C style header with the actuals structure (similar to ./dynStruct.py -e or ./dynStruct.py -c).

### Blocks and Access
The detailed view of blocks display blocks informations, all accesses made in this block and a link to the corresponding structure if any.
The context instruction is the previous instruction for a write access and the next one for a read access, this is used to in the structure recovery process.
![Block detailed view] (http://i.imgur.com/sB4PpjD.png)

### Structures
You can access structures detailed view by clicking on the name of the structure in the structures search page.
![structure detailed view] (http://i.imgur.com/AVeVyjr.png)

On this view you have the information about the structure, the members of the structure and the list of blocks which are instances of this structure. You can edit the members of the structure and the list of blocks associated with this structure.    
  
There is also a detailed view for each member with the list of accesses made to this member on each block associated with the structure.
![member detailed view] (http://i.imgur.com/cGJN0ZC.png)

A member can be an inner structure, an array, an array of structure or a simple member (everything which don't match with the previous categories). Union and bitfield are not actually handle by dynStruct.

When you edit a structure you can remove it, remove a member (on the edit member view), or edit a member (it's name, type, size and number of units in the case of an array). You can also create new member in the place of any padding member.
![edit member view](http://i.imgur.com/GmNyNra.png)

On the Edit instance view you can select multiple blocks (by clicking on them) of the first list to remove them and multiple blocks on the second list to add them. When you click on Edit instances both selected suppression and addition will be executed.  
On the second list only blocks with the same size than the structure and not already associated with the structure will be displayed.
![edit instance view] (http://i.imgur.com/an97OHp.png)

### Edits saving
All edits are saved in the serialized file if any (work with files give with args -o and -p).

### Known issue
The web interface is run via the same script than the structure recovery, so thay the web interface have the same issue than the structure recovery.
